${context.relatedClasses}
#end

#if( $context.currentClass.length() > 0 )
This is the class where the source code resides:
${context.currentClass}
#end
${context.extContext}
Here is the source code to be tested:

```$context.lang
${context.imports}
${context.sourceCode}
```

#if($context.isNewFile)
